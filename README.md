# MovieNight
We’ve all experienced indecisiveness when it comes to picking a movie to watch. Maybe it’s just a matter of picking a movie that everyone will agree on but either way no one wants to waste time filtering through thousands of movies.

# Installation Instructions
We didn't deploy our app so in order to run this we would have to run it with flask.
First we want to make sure we have python3 and pip3 installed on our machines. 
Python can be downloaded by following this link and download instructions
      https://www.python.org/downloads/
pip3 should be installed with python3 >= 3.4
a virtual environment should be created for the project from repository code but if it is not create a virtual environment and install the following within it
pip3 install flask
pip3 install flask_bootstrap
pip3 install flask_wtf
pip3 install flask_sqlalchemy
pip3 install flask_login
Run the app and it should work as expected
