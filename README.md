# MovieNight
We’ve all experienced indecisiveness when it comes to picking a movie to watch. Maybe it’s just a matter of picking a movie that everyone will agree on but either way no one wants to waste time filtering through thousands of movies.

# Installation Instructions
We didn't deploy our app so in order to run this we would have to run it with flask.
First we want to make sure we have python3 and pip3 installed on our machines. 
Python can be downloaded by following this link and download instructions.
https://www.python.org/downloads/ .pip3 should be installed with python3 >= 3.4.A virtual environment should be created for the project from repository code but if it is not create a virtual environment and install the following within it ---
1 . pip3 install flask 2. pip3 install flask_bootstrap 3.pip3 install flask_wtf 4.pip3 install flask_sqlalchemy 5.pip3 install flask_login. ---Run the app and it should work as expected
